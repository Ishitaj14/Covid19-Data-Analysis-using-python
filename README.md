# Covid19-Data-Analysis-using-python
This project is a basic data analysis of the Covid19 data using python with the aim to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country. 

## Introduction
This project was done as a part of the course undertook by me from cousera, I preprocessed and merged datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for Analysis.I worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also there is another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country. 

## Steps involved

-Importing Covid19 dataset     

-Finding a good Measure     

-Importing and preparing World happiness report dataset     

-Merged two datasets and find correlations among the data

-Visualized results using Seaborn    

## Conclusion
It was noticed that there is a positive correlation among the columns related to Happiness of people, living in a country and the column, related to spread of the virus in that country. This brought us to the conclusionn that developed countries are more prone to getting the infection.
